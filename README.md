# hyperskill-budget-manager
A Java project from the Hyperskill learning platform.
This application tracks purchases entered by the user and can display and sort purchases and totals by category.

## Project structure
Most of the top level folders contain instruction files for the stages of the project. My own code for the application can be found in [task/src/budget](task/src/budget).
